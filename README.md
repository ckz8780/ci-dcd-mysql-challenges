# Welcome! 

This is a quick demo of using some basic SQL commands. It is part of the Data Centric Development module for CodeInstitute.

#### Notes:

- Challenge solutions are located in the relevant "Challenge Solutions" folders.
- Some challenge output files have been modified slightly to improve readability, so copying/pasting commands may not work as expected.
- SQL file used to build the database is in the root.
- Running mysql-from-python.py requires installing pymysql (`sudo pip3 install pymysql`)
